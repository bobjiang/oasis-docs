层。\n\n共识层 是一种可扩展的、高吞吐量的、安全的、基于 pos 的共识，由一组去中心化的验证器节点运行。\n\nParaTime 层 托管许多并行运行时 (ParaTimes), 每一个运行时都代表一个具有共享状态的复制计算环境。\n\n\n\n技术亮点\n\n将共识和执行分为两层——共识层和 ParaTime 层——以实现更好的可扩展性和通用性 。\n\n共识和执行相分离，使得多个 ParaTimes 可以并行处理交易，这意味着一个 ParaTime 上的复杂计算不会拖慢另一个 ParaTime 上的简单计算。\n\nParaTime 层是完全去中心化的，允许 任何人开发和建立自己的 ParaTime。每个 ParaTime 都可以单独开发，以满足特定应用的需求，如保密计算、开放或关闭委员会等。\n\n网络先进的差异检测功能使 Oasis比分片和并行链更有效——对于同等的安全级别，所需要的复制因子更小。\n\nOasis 对保密计算技术有广泛的支持。Oasis Eth/WASI Runtime 是一个保密的 ParaTime 的开源例子，它使用安全区域飞地（secure enclaves）在处理数据时保持数据的私密性。\n\n\nOasis Network 的技术优势\n可伸缩性\nOasis Network 通过一组尖端技术实现了独一无二的可扩展性，这些功能提供了比其他网络更快的交易速度和更高的吞吐量。而这一顶级性能，在很大程度上是由于它将计算和共识分离成了共识层和 ParaTime 层。这种分离允许多个 ParaTimes 并行处理计算，也就是说一个 ParaTime 上的复杂计算是不会减慢另一个 ParaTime 上的简单计算的。此外，Oasis 的复杂差异检测也使得 Oasis 比分片和平行链更有效率，因为针对相同级别的安全性来说，其所需要的复制因子更小。\n隐私优先\nOasis Network 设计了有史以来第一个支持保密智能合约的 ParaTime。在该 ParaTime 中，节点须在一个\n“TEE” (Trusted Execution Environment) 的受信任的执行环境中进行安全计算。此时，TEE 充当的是该智能合约执行时假设的黑匣子。也就是说，当加密过的数据和智能合约被发送至这个黑匣子时，数据便会被解密，然后再由智能合约进行处理，处理完后，数据会被再一次进行加密处理，最后才从 TEE 中发送出来。整个过程确保了数据的保密性，且永远不会泄漏给节点操作员或应用程序开发人员。\nOasis Eth/WASI Runtime 是一个使用英特尔 SGX 的保密 ParaTime 的开源例子。此外，还可以使用其他安全计算技术，如 ZKP、HE 或其他安全计算技术。在未来，我们希望支持更多的计算技术，如安全多方计算，联邦学习等。\n这种保密特性解锁了一系列 Oasis Network 上涉及个人敏感数据的应用案例，比如与个人社保信息、银行对帐单和健康信息相关的信息，而如果在一层区块链上直接使用这些数据，将具有极大泄漏的风险。\n功能多样性\nOasis Network 是为支持下一代区块链应用程序而设计的，因此它具有令人难以置信的多样性、敏捷性和可定制性。也就是说，每个 ParaTime 都可以单独开发，以满足特定应用程序的需要。ParaTimes 委员会可大可小、可开放也可以关闭，从而根据特定用例需求执行更快或更安全的操作。节点可能需要具备特定的硬件，例如在保密 ParaTime 中的安全飞地。每个 ParaTime 都可以类似地运行不同的 Runtime VM (ParaTime 引擎)，如 EVM 向后兼容引擎、基于 Rust 的智能合约语言或数据通证化引擎。最后，为了支持企业和开发人员用例，ParaTimes 还可以是需要许可的或者无需许可的，协会可以拥有他们自己的封闭的 ParaTime，或者社区也可以拥有完全去中心化的开放的 ParaTime。\nParaTime 层的多功能性允许 Oasis Network 扩展并以引入新的用例，但同时仍然保持着相同的核心账本和共识层。\n"},"oasis-network/network-parameters.html":{"url":"oasis-network/network-parameters.html","title":"Network Parameters","summary":"This page is meant to be kept up to

Links to the binaries are provided in the Network Parameters page.\nBuilding From Source\nAlthough highly suggested, building from source is currently beyond the scope of this documentation.\nSee Oasis Core's Build Environment Setup and Building documentation for more details.\nThe code in the master branch might be incompatible with the code used by other nodes in the Mainnet.\nMake sure to use the version specified in the Network Parameters.\n\nAdding oasis-node Binary to PATH\nTo install the oasis-node binary for the current user, copy/symlink it to ~/.local/bin.\nTo install the oasis-node binary for all users of the system, copy it to /usr/local/bin.\n"},"run-a-node/set-up-your-node/":{"url":"run-a-node/set-up-your-node/","title":"Set Up Your Node","keywords":"","body":"Set Up Your Node\n"},"run-a-node/set-up-your-node/run-validator.html":{"url":"run-a-node/set-up-your-node/run-validator.html","title":"Run a Validator Node 长，技术术语多","summary":"This page describes how to run a validator node on the Oasis Network.","keywords":"","body":"Run a Validator Node\nThese instructions are for setting up a validator node. If you want to run a non-validator node instead, see the instructions on running a non-validator node.\n\nThis guide will cover setting up your validator node for the Oasis Network. This guide assumes some basic knowledge on the use of command line tools.\nPrerequisites\nBefore following this guide, make sure you've followed the Prerequisites section and have the Oasis Node binary installed on your systems.\nStake requirements\nTo become a validator on the Oasis Network, you need to have enough tokens staked in your escrow account. For more details, see the Stake requirements section of Run a Validator Node doc.\nSystems\nThis guide assumes that you have two different physical machines that you will use for deployment. These machines are the following:\n\nYour local system, henceforth called the localhost.\nA remote system to run as an Oasis node, henceforth called the server.\n\nThe reason for this is to ensure protection of the keys used to setup your node. Use of HSMs to store keys is highly recommended.\nCreating Your Entity\nEverything in this section should be done on the localhost as there are sensitive items that will be created.\n\nCreating a Working Directory\nDuring this entity initialization process, we will create keys and other important artifacts that are necessary for the deployment of nodes on the network. It is important that you save and protect the generated artifacts in this directory if you intend to use them to register your entity and nodes.\nInside /localhostdir you should create the following directories:\n\nentity: This will store your entity. The private contents in this directory are safest if used on a machine kept disconnected from the internet.\nThe directory's permissions should be rwx------\n\nnode: This will store a node we are calling \"node\". The name is not important. It simply represents one of your nodes. You can rename it to whatever you wish. The private contents of this directory will be used on the node itself.\nYou should initialize this information on a system with access to the entity's private key.\nThe directory permissions should be rwx------\n\n\nTo create the directory structure, use the following command:\nmkdir -m700 -p {entity,node}\n\nCopying the Genesis File\nThe latest genesis file can be found in Network Parameters. You should download the latest genesis.json file, copy it to the working directory and set the following environment variable pointing to its path:\nGENESIS_FILE_PATH=/localhostdir/genesis.json\n\nThis will be needed later when generating transactions.\nInitializing an Entity\nAn entity is critical to operating nodes on the network as it controls the stake attached to a given individual or organization on the network. We highly recommend using an HSM or Ledger device to protect your entity private key.\nUsing a Ledger-based Signer\nThe Ledger-based signer stores your private keys on your Ledger wallet. It is implemented as an Oasis Core signer plugin.\nYou will need to set it up as described in the Setup section of our Oasis Core Ledger docs.\nAs the entity's private key is stored on your Ledger wallet, you only need to export the entity's public key as described in Exporting Public Key to Entity section of our Oasis Core Ledger docs.\nThis will create 1 file in /localhostdir/entity:\n\nentity.json: The entity descriptor. This is the JSON of the unsigned information to be sent to the registry application on the network.\n\nThere will be no signed entity descriptor, i.e. entity_genesis.json, created yet. It will get created when you'll update the entity descriptor with your signed node descriptor as described in the Adding the Node to the Entity Descriptor section.\n\nUsing a File-based Signer\nWe strongly suggest that you do not use any entity that is generated with the file-based signer on the Mainnet.\nWhen using the file-based signer the use of an offline/air-gapped machine for this purpose is highly recommended. Gaining access to the entity private key can compromise your tokens.\n\nTo initialize an entity simply run the following from /localhostdir/entity:\noasis-node registry entity init\n\nThis will generate three files in /localhostdir/entity:\n\nentity.pem: The private key of the entity. NEVER SHARE THIS AS IT CAN BE USED TO TRANSFER STAKE.\nentity.json: The entity descriptor. This is the JSON of the unsigned information to be sent to the registry application on the network.\nentity_genesis.json: This JSON object contains the entity descriptor that has been signed with entity's private key, i.e. entity.pem. This is meant to be shared for inclusion in the Genesis block.\n\nInitializing a Node\nA node registers itself to the network when the node starts up. However, in order to validate itself, the entity signs a public key associated with the node. This allows the node registration to happen without the uploading entity's private key to the internet.\nTo get the $ENTITY_ID needed below check the value of the id field in entity.json, e.g. with the following content in entity.json:\n{\"v\":1,\"id\":\"2D5nSE3uFGvp2UkUY3w8OSjnCCYmQX/3JpJ77+aJGUQ=\"}\n\nthe entity ID is 2D5nSE3uFGvp2UkUY3w8OSjnCCYmQX/3JpJ77+aJGUQ=.\n\nTo initialize a validator node, take note of the static IP of the server where your node will run, and issue the following commands from the /localhostdir/node directory:\nENTITY_ID=\nSTATIC_IP=\noasis-node registry node init \\\n  --node.entity_id $ENTITY_ID \\\n  --node.consensus_address $STATIC_IP:26656 \\\n  --node.role validator\n\nThis command will create a validator node's identity so that it can be a self-signed node (this is what allows self-registration).\nThere are more options for node initialization that you can explore by running:\noasis-node registry node init --help\n\nThe options shown above are just the minimum.\n\nThe command will generate the following files:\n\nconsensus.pem: The node's consensus private key. DO NOT SHARE\nconsensus_pub.pem: The node's consensus public key.\nidentity.pem: The node's identity private key. DO NOT SHARE\nidentity_pub.pem: The node's identity public key.\nnode_genesis.json: The node's details if you wish to include this node in the genesis file of the network.\np2p.pem: The node's private key for libp2p. DO NOT SHARE\np2p_pub.pem: The node's public key for libp2p.\nsentry_client_tls_identity.pem: The node's TLS private key for communicating with sentry nodes. DO NOT SHARE\nsentry_client_tls_identity_cert.pem: The node's TLS certificate for communicating with sentry nodes.\n\nAdding the Node to the Entity Descriptor\nOnce the node has been initialized, we need to add it to the entity descriptor so that it can properly register itself when the node starts up. The instructions differ based on what kind of signer was used to generate the entity.\n\nIf using the plugin-based signer, execute the following command in the /localhostdir/entity directory (again this assumes the use of the Ledger signer plugin in which case you will need to then confirm the signing operation on the Ledger device):\n\noasis-node registry entity update \\\n    --signer.backend plugin \\\n    --signer.plugin.name ledger \\\n    --signer.plugin.path \"$LEDGER_SIGNER_PATH\" \\\n    --signer.plugin.config \"wallet_id:$LEDGER_WALLET_ID,index:$LEDGER_INDEX\" \\\n    --entity.node.descriptor /localhost/node/node_genesis.json\n\n\nIf using the file-based signer, execute the following command in the /localhostdir/entity directory:\n\noasis-node registry entity update \\\n  --entity.node.descriptor /localhost/node/node_genesis.json\n\nThis will update the entity descriptor in entity.json and subsequently the entity_genesis.json file that contains the signed entity descriptor payload.\nRunning an Oasis Node on the server\nSetting up the Oasis Node's Working Directory\nBefore we run the node on the server we need to ensure that we have a place to store necessary files for the node.\nWe will reference the working directory on the server as /serverdir throughout the documentation.\n\nSetting Up the the /serverdir Directory\nIn the /serverdir directory we will create the following subdirectories:\n\netc/ - this is to store the configuration\nnode/ - this is to store the node's data\nnode/entity/ - this is to store the public components of the node's entity\n\nYou can make this directory structure by executing the following command:\nmkdir -m700 -p /serverdir/{etc,node,node/entity}\n\nCopying the Node Artifacts from /localhostdir\nIn order for the node registration to work properly, as defined in /localhostdir/entity.json, you must copy the node's artifacts you generated in the Initializing a Node section. To do so, upload the following files from /localhostdir/node to /serverdir/node over a secure channel (e.g. SSH):\n\nconsensus.pem\nconsensus_pub.pem\nidentity.pem\nidentity_pub.pem\np2p.pem\np2p_pub.pem\nsentry_client_tls_identity.pem\nsentry_client_tls_identity_cert.pem\n\nAfter copying, make sure that all these files have 0600 permissions, i.e. only their owner has read and write permissions.\nTo do so, run the following command:\nchmod -R 600 /serverdir/node/*.pem\n\nYou may have noticed that some of these files were listed as DO NOT SHARE in the Initializing a Node section.\nIn the future, these keys should be generated and referenced from an HSM. However, until HSM support is implemented, these keys should be kept as secure as possible on the server.\n\nCopying the Public Entity Artifacts from /localhostdir\nWe will also need to have the public entity artifacts from the /localhostdir present on the server. Copy the /localhostdir/entity/entity.json file on localhost to /serverdir/node/entity/entity.json on the server.\nCopying the Genesis File to the server\nThe latest Genesis file can be found in the Network Parameters. You should download the latest genesis.json file and copy it to /serverdir/etc/genesis.json on the server.\nConfiguring the Oasis Node\nThere are a variety of options available when running an Oasis node. The following YAML file is a basic configuration for a validator node on the network.\nBefore using this configuration you should collect the following information to replace the  variables present in the configuration file:\n\n``: The external IP you used when registering this node.\n\nIf you are using a Sentry Node, you should use the public IP of that machine.\n\n\n`: The seed node address in the formID@IP:port`.\nYou can find the current Oasis Seed Node address in the Network Parameters.\n\n\nTo use this configuration, save it in the /serverdir/etc/config.yml file and pass it to the oasis-node command as an argument to the --config flag.\n##\n# Oasis Node Configuration\n#\n# This file's contents are derived from the command line arguments found in the\n# root command of the oasis-node binary. For more information, execute:\n#\n#     oasis-node --help\n#\n# Settings on the command line that are separated by a dot all belong to the\n# same nested object. For example, \"--foo.bar.baz hello\" would translate to:\n#\n#     foo:\n#       bar:\n#         baz: hello\n##\n\n# Set this to where you wish to store node data. The node's artifacts\n# should also be located in this directory.\ndatadir: /serverdir/node\n\n# Logging.\n#\n# Per-module log levels are defined below. If you prefer just one unified log\n# level, you can use:\n#\n# log:\n#   level: debug\nlog:\n  level:\n    # Per-module log levels. Longest prefix match will be taken. Fallback to\n    # \"default\", if no match.\n    default: debug\n    tendermint: warn\n    tendermint/context: error\n  format: JSON\n  # By default logs are output to stdout. If you would like to output logs to\n  # a file, you can use:\n  #\n  # file: /var/log/oasis-node.log\n\n# Genesis.\ngenesis:\n  # Path to the genesis file for the current version of the network.\n  file: /serverdir/etc/genesis.json\n\n# Worker configuration.\nworker:\n  registration:\n    # In order for the node to register itself, the entity.json of the entity\n    # used to provision the node must be available on the node.\n    entity: /serverdir/node/entity/entity.json\n\n# Consensus backend.\nconsensus:\n  # Setting this to true will mean that the node you're deploying will attempt\n  # to register as a validator.\n  validator: true\n\n  # Tendermint backend configuration.\n  tendermint:\n    core:\n      listen_address: tcp://0.0.0.0:26656\n\n      # The external IP that is used when registering this node to the network.\n      # NOTE: If you are using the Sentry node setup, this option should be\n      # omitted.\n      external_address: tcp://{{ external_address }}:26656\n\n    # List of seed nodes to connect to.\n    # NOTE: You can add additional seed nodes to this list if you want.\n    p2p:\n      seed:\n        - \"{{ seed_node_address }}\"\n\nEnsuring Proper Permissions\nOnly the owner of the process that runs the Oasis node should have access to the files in the /serverdir/node directory. The oasis-node binary ensures that the files used by the node are as least privileged as possible so that you don't accidentally shoot yourself in the foot while operating a node.\nTo ensure proper permissions are set, we suggest running the following to remove all non-owner read/write/execute permissions:\nchmod -R go-r,go-w,go-x /serverdir\n\nJust so it's clear, the following permissions are expected by the oasis-node binary:\n\n700 for the /serverdir/node directory\n700 for the /serverdir/node/entity directory\n600 for all *.pem files\n\n\nStarting the Oasis Node\nYou can start the node by running the following command:\noasis-node --config /serverdir/etc/config.yml\n\nThe Oasis node is configured to run in the foreground by default.\nWe recommend you configure and use it with a process manager like systemd or Supervisor.\n\nVerifying the Connection to the Network\nAs part of the starting the server process, the oasis-node binary will, by default, setup an internal unix socket in the datadir of the Node. This socket can be used to communicate to the node and query details about the network.\nRun the following command:\noasis-node registry entity list -a unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock\n\nIf this command fails, you'll receive a non-zero exit code and there's a high likelihood that you are not connected to the network. However, if it does work properly it should respond with output like the following but with potentially many more values:\nCVzqFIADD2Ed0khGBNf4Rvh7vSNtrL1ULTkWYQszDpc=\nC5z1jB+FHB/QgtTITr6NKWpUs9QHwD11CG3v8tmuJ0g=\nDPbZomOIleFrvcJBZPl7y/wEB1w9Q569vAbb6Krl9fE=\nDVobZ8bWlOv2J6oHO0uITr5FPO5rIY2irdPNhByprHk=\nD2hqhJcmZnBmhw9TodOdoFPAjmRkpRatANCNHxIDHgA=\n\nOnce you get to a node that's connected you can move on to the next section as your node is not yet registered as a validator on the Oasis Network.\nStaking and Registering\nThis step is not necessary if your entity was fully staked at genesis.\n\nIf you've submitted staking or registry transactions before, your nonce is likely different than the nonce used in the examples. If you're uncertain, please check your account nonce by using this guide.\n\nOnce you have been funded, you can complete the process of connecting your node to the network by registering both your entity and your node, as described below.\nCheck that your node is synced\nBefore you can make any transactions you'll have to make sure that your node is synced. To do so call this command on the server:\noasis-node control is-synced -a unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock\n\nIf your node is synced, the above command should output:\nnode completed initial syncing\n\nIf your node is not yet synced, you will need to wait before you can move forward.\nGenerating a Staking (Escrow) Transaction on the localhost\nYour entity's private key should be disconnected from the internet on the localhost. Therefore, you need to generate the following transaction on the localhost.\nThe entity's private key is used to authorize transactions on your staking account.\nHence it should never be present on the online server.\n\nThe current minimum stake required to register an entity and register a node as a validator is 200 tokens. So, we will generate an escrow transaction that escrows 200 tokens on your own entity.\nThe Oasis node's staking application calls the operation of staking tokens \"escrow.\"\n\nBefore generating the escrow transaction, you need to set the following environment variables:\n\nGENESIS_FILE_PATH: Path to the Genesis file on the localhost, i.e. /localhostdir/genesis.json.\nENTITY_DIR_PATH: Path to entity's artifacts directory on the localhost,\ni.e. /localhostdir/entity/.\n\nOUTPUT_TX_FILE_PATH: Path to the file containing the outputted signed transaction.\nFor this guide, we will use /localhostdir/signed-escrow.tx.\n\nACCOUNT_ADDRESS: Your staking account address.\nTo obtain your staking account address from your Entity's ID, see Obtaining Account Address From Entity's ID.\n\n\nThen execute the following command:\noasis-node stake account gen_escrow \\\n  --genesis.file $GENESIS_FILE_PATH \\\n  --signer.backend file \\\n  --signer.dir $ENTITY_DIR_PATH \\\n  --stake.escrow.account $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS \\\n  --stake.amount 200000000000 \\\n  --transaction.file $OUTPUT_TX_FILE_PATH \\\n  --transaction.fee.gas 2269 \\\n  --transaction.fee.amount 2000 \\\n  --transaction.nonce 0\n\nThe option --stake.amount looks like a very large number, but this is actually just an equivalent to 200 tokens on the Amber Network as each unit value used to track the account balance is 1x10^-9 tokens.\nThe --transactions.fee.gas and --transaction.fee.amount options depend on the network configuration, see Common Transaction Flags for details.\n\nGenerating Entity Registration Transaction\nBefore you can run your node successfully, you'll need to register your entity so that your node registers properly. You could do this process after you submit the escrow transaction, however, to save steps we prepare everything before hand.\nBefore generating the register transaction, you need to set the following environment variables:\n\nGENESIS_FILE_PATH: Path to the Genesis file on the localhost, i.e.\n/localhostdir/genesis.json.\n\nENTITY_DIR_PATH: Path to entity's artifacts directory on the localhost,\ni.e. /localhostdir/entity/.\n\nOUTPUT_REGISTER_TX_FILE_PATH: Path to the file containing the outputted signed transaction.\nFor this guide, we will use /localhostdir/signed-register.tx.\n\n\nThen execute the following command:\noasis-node registry entity gen_register \\\n  --genesis.file $GENESIS_FILE_PATH \\\n  --signer.backend file \\\n  --signer.dir $ENTITY_DIR_PATH \\\n  --transaction.file $OUTPUT_REGISTER_TX_FILE_PATH \\\n  --transaction.fee.gas 2460 \\\n  --transaction.fee.amount 1000 \\\n  --transaction.nonce 1\n\nThe --transactions.fee.gas and --transaction.fee.amount options depend on the network configuration, see Common Transaction Flags for details.\n\nSubmitting Your Transactions on the server\nTo complete the staking process we need to copy the generated escrow and registry transactions from your offline localhost to the server and submit them.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\nCopy the file /localhostdir/signed-escrow.tx on the localhost to\n/serverdir/signed-escrow.tx on the server.\n\nCopy the file /localhostdir/signed-register.tx on the localhost to\n/serverdir/signed-register.tx on the server.\n\nSubmit both transactions via oasis-node consensus submit_tx sub-command:\noasis-node consensus submit_tx \\\n --transaction.file /serverdir/signed-escrow.tx \\\n -a unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock\noasis-node consensus submit_tx \\\n --transaction.file /serverdir/signed-register.tx \\\n -a unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock\n\n\n\nChecking that Your Node is Properly Registered\nTo ensure that your node is properly connected as a validator on the network, you can run the following command:\noasis-node control status -a unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock\n\nIf your node is registered and a validator, the above command should output (some fields omitted for clarity):\n{\n  \"software_version\": \"20.10\",\n  \"identity\": {\n    ...\n  },\n  \"consensus\": {\n    \"consensus_version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"backend\": \"tendermint\",\n    \"features\": 3,\n    \"node_peers\": [\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"latest_height\": 55899,\n    \"latest_hash\": \"AR34gxwWz1LS5rMDa6E0L1/ThW9E38ySIbRRlRG/shg=\",\n    \"latest_time\": \"2020-08-10T11:38:26+02:00\",\n    \"latest_state_root\": {\n      \"ns\": \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=\",\n      \"version\": 55898,\n      \"hash\": \"h2+8ZryxseOKpuSho1nVSImLF/irVsTF5xryc3I9cRk=\"\n    },\n    \"genesis_height\": 1,\n    \"genesis_hash\": \"+SIAMCUeZtWuYPg/Ke+zwPRhNRripRgUq1d5Al9ImNA=\",\n    \"is_validator\": true\n  },\n  \"registration\": {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nPay attention to the is_validator field which should have the value of true.\nNodes are only elected into the validator set at epoch transitions, so you may need to wait for up to an epoch before being considered.\n\nNote that in order to be elected in the validator set you need to have enough stake to be in the top K entities (where K is a network-specific parameter specified by the scheduler.max_validators field in the genesis document).\n\nYou're a Validator!\nIf you've made it this far, you've properly connected your node to the network and you're now a validator on the Oasis Network.\n"},"run-a-node/set-up-your-node/run-non-validator.html":{"url":"run-a-node/set-up-your-node/run-non-validator.html","title":"Run a Non-validator Node","summary":"This page describes how to run a non-validator node on the Oasis Network.","keywords":"","body":"Run a Non-validator Node\nThese instructions are for setting up a non-validator node.

Because of that, we'll specify that our rate also starts on epoch 1500.\nLet's generate an amend commission schedule transaction for this example and store it to tx_amend_commission_schedule.json:\noasis-node stake account gen_amend_commission_schedule \\\n  \"${TX_FLAGS[@]}\" \\\n  --stake.commission_schedule.bounds 1500/0/25000 \\\n  --stake.commission_schedule.rates 1500/10000 \\\n  --transaction.file tx_amend_commission_schedule.json \\\n  --transaction.nonce 10 \\\n  --transaction.fee.gas 1000 \\\n  --transaction.fee.amount 2000\n\nRates and minimum/maximum rates are in units of 1/100,000, so 0, 50000, and 100000 come out to 0%, 50%, and 100%, respectively.\n\nThis will output a preview of the generated transaction:\nYou are about to sign the following transaction:\n  Nonce:  10\n  Fee:\n    Amount: ROSE 0.000002\n    Gas limit: 1000\n    (gas price: ROSE 0.000000002 per gas unit)\n  Method: staking.AmendCommissionSchedule\n  Body:\n    Amendment:\n      Rates:\n        (1) start: epoch 1500\n            rate:  10.0%\n      Rate Bounds:\n        (1) start:        epoch 1500\n            minimum rate: 0.0%\n            maximum rate: 25.0%\nOther info:\n  Genesis document's hash: 976c302f696e417bd861b599e79261244f4391f3887a488212ee122ca7bbf0a8\n\nand ask you for confirmation.\nSubmit the Transaction\nTo submit the generated transaction, we need to copy tx_amend_commission_schedule.json to the online Oasis node (i.e. the server) and submit it from there:\noasis-node consensus submit_tx \\\n  -a $ADDR \\\n  --transaction.file tx_amend_commission_schedule.json\n\nQuery Our Account's Info Again\nLet's check our account's info again:\nGeneral Account:\n  ...\n  Nonce:   11\nEscrow Account:\n  ...\n  Commission Schedule:\n    Rates:\n      (1) start: epoch 1500\n          rate:  10.0%\n    Rate Bounds:\n      (1) start:        epoch 1500\n          minimum rate: 0.0%\n          maximum rate: 25.0%\n  ...\n\nWe can observe that:\n\nOur account's nonce increased to 11.\nWe set the commission rate of 10.0% to start on epoch 1500.\nWe set the commission rate bounds of 0% - 25% to also start on epoch 1500.\n\nFor more information on how commissions work in general, see the Commission explanation in the Use Your Tokens docs.\n\nSetting a More Complex Commission Schedule\nIt is also possible to set multiple commission rate steps and rate bound steps by passing the --stake.commission_schedule.rates and --stake.commission_schedule.bounds CLI flags multiple times.\nFor example, setting multiple commission rate steps and rate bound steps (for the same account as in the previous example) as follows:\noasis-node stake account gen_amend_commission_schedule \\\n  \"${TX_FLAGS[@]}\" \\\n  --stake.commission_schedule.bounds 2000/10000/30000 \\\n  --stake.commission_schedule.bounds 3000/20000/40000 \\\n  --stake.commission_schedule.rates 2000/15000 \\\n  --stake.commission_schedule.rates 2200/20000 \\\n  --stake.commission_schedule.rates 2500/25000 \\\n  --stake.commission_schedule.rates 2800/30000 \\\n  --stake.commission_schedule.rates 3000/35000 \\\n  --transaction.file tx_amend_commission_schedule.json \\\n  --transaction.nonce 11 \\\n  --transaction.fee.gas 1000 \\\n  --transaction.fee.amount 2000\nwould result in the following commission schedule being printed out in our account's info:\n...\nEscrow Account:\n  ...\n  Commission Schedule:\n    Rates:\n      (1) start: epoch 1500\n          rate:  10.0%\n      (2) start: epoch 2000\n          rate:  15.0%\n      (3) start: epoch 2200\n          rate:  20.0%\n      (4) start: epoch 2500\n          rate:  25.0%\n      (5) start: epoch 2800\n          rate:  30.0%\n      (6) start: epoch 3000\n          rate:  35.0%\n    Rate Bounds:\n      (1) start:        epoch 1500\n          minimum rate: 0.0%\n          maximum rate: 25.0%\n      (2) start:        epoch 2000\n          minimum rate: 10.0%\n          maximum rate: 30.0%\n      (3) start:        epoch 3000\n          minimum rate: 20.0%\n          maximum rate: 40.0%\n  ...\n\nTo troubleshoot an amendment that's rejected, consult our compendium of 23 common ways for a commission schedule amendment to fail.\n\n"},"run-a-node/set-up-your-node/sentry-node-architecture.html":{"url":"run-a-node/set-up-your-node/sentry-node-architecture.html","title":"Sentry Node Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Sentry Node Architecture\nThis guide provides instructions for a deployment using the Sentry node architecture to protect validator nodes from being directly exposed on the public network.\nThis guide assumes a setup where an Oasis validator node is only accessible over a private network, with sentry nodes having access to it. The guide does not cover setting this infrastructure up. Knowledge of Tendermint's Sentry Node architecture is assumed as well.\nThis is only an example of a Sentry node deployment, and we take no responsibility for mistakes contained therein. Make sure you understand what you are doing.\n\nPrerequisites\nBefore following this guide, make sure you've read the Prerequisites and Running a Node on the Network guides and created your Entity.\nConfiguring the Oasis Sentry Node\nInitializing Sentry Node\nSentry node identity keys can be initialized with:\noasis-node identity init --datadir /serverdir/node\n\nConfiguring Sentry Node\nAn Oasis node can be configured to run as a sentry node by setting the worker.sentry.enabled flag. The tendermint.sentry.upstream_address flag can be used to configure a list of nodes that will be protected by the sentry node.\nAn example of full YAML configuration of a sentry node is below.\nBefore using this configuration you should collect the following information to replace the  variables present in the configuration file:\n\n``: This is the external IP on which sentry node will be reachable.\n`: This the seed node address of the formID@IP:port`. You can find the current Oasis Seed Node address in the Network Parameters.\n``: This is the Tendermint ID (address) of the Oasis validator node that will be protected by the sentry node. This address can be obtained by running:\noasis-node identity tendermint show-node-address --datadir /serverdir/node\n\non the validator node.\n\n``: This is the (presumably) private address on which validator should be reachable from the sentry node.\n\n``: This is the public TLS key of the Oasis validator node that will be protected by the sentry node. This public key can be obtained by running:\n oasis-node identity show-sentry-client-pubkey --datadir /serverdir/node\n\non the validator node. Note that the above command is only available in oasis-node from version 20.8.1 onward.\n\n\n##\n# Oasis Sentry Node Configuration\n#\n# This file's configurations are derived from the command line args found in the\n# root command of the oasis-node binary.

The Oasis validator only needs to be able to connect to its sentry nodes, preferably via a private network.\nInitializing Validator Node\nIf your validator node is already registered and running in a non-sentry setup, this step can be skipped as the Oasis validator will update its address in the Registry automatically once we redeploy it with new configuration.\n\nWhen you are initializing a validator node, you should use the sentry node's external address and Consensus ID in the node.consensus_address flag. If you are running multiple sentry nodes, you can specify the node.consensus_address flag multiple times.\nTo initialize a validator node with 2 sentry nodes, run the following commands from the /localhostdir/node directory:\nexport SENTRY1_CONSENSUS_ID=\nexport SENTRY1_STATIC_IP=\nexport SENTRY2_CONSENSUS_ID=\nexport SENTRY2_STATIC_IP=\noasis-node registry node init \\\n  --signer.backend file \\\n  --signer.dir /localhostdir/entity \\\n  --node.consensus_address $SENTRY1_CONSENSUS_ID@$SENTRY1_STATIC_IP:26656 \\\n  --node.consensus_address $SENTRY2_CONSENSUS_ID@$SENTRY2_STATIC_IP:26656 \\\n  --node.is_self_signed \\\n  --node.role validator\n\nSENTRY_CONSENSUS_ID: This is the Consensus ID of the sentry node in base64 format. This ID can be obtained from consensus_pub.pem:\nsed -n 2p /serverdir/node/consensus_pub.pem\n\non the sentry node.\n\nConfiguring the Validator Node\nThere are some configuration changes needed for the Oasis validator node to enable proxying through its sentry node. Most of these flags should be familiar from the Tendermint sentry node architecture.\nSince the validator node will not have an external address, the consensus.tendermint.core.external_address flag should be skipped. Similarly, the consensus.tendermint.p2p.seed flag can be skipped, as the oasis-node won't be directly connecting to any of the seed nodes.\nTendermint Peer Exchange should be disabled on the validator with the consensus.tendermint.p2p.disable_peer_exchange flag.\nSentry nodes can also be configured as Tendermint Persistent-Peers with the consensus.tendermint.p2p.persistent_peer flag.\nIn addition to the familiar Tendermint setup above, the node needs to be configured to query sentry nodes for external addresses every time the validator preforms a re-registration. This is configured with the worker.sentry.address flag.\nThe worker.sentry.address flag is of format: @ip:port where:\n\n: Is the sentry node's TLS public key.\nip:port: Is the (private) address of the sentry node's control endpoint.\n\nPutting it all together, an example configuration of a validator node in the sentry node architecture is given below.\nBefore using this configuration you should collect the following information to replace the {{ var_name }} variables present in the configuration file:\n\n``: This is the private IP address of the sentry node over which sentry node should be accessible to the validator.\n``: This is the sentry node's control endpoint TLS public key. This ID can be obtained by running:\n oasis-node identity show-tls-pubkey --datadir /serverdir/node\n\non the sentry node. Note that the above command is only available in oasis-node from version 20.8.1 onward.\n\n``: This is the Tendermint ID (address) of the sentry node that will be configured as a Persistent Peer. This ID can be obtained by running:\noasis-node identity tendermint show-node-address --datadir /serverdir/node\n\non the sentry node.\n\n\n##\n# Oasis Node Configuration\n#\n# This file's configurations are derived from the command line args found in\n# the root command of the oasis-node binary.

For this upgrade, we changed it back to the value in the Mainnet Beta genesis file to include the Oasis network's genesis quote: ”Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” [submitted by Oasis Community Member Daniyar Borangaziyev].\n\nThe balances in the genesis file are enumerated in nROSE, with 1 billion nROSE being equivalent to 1 ROSE token. For more details, see the Genesis File Overview.\n\nIf you obtain the same result, then you have successfully verified the provided genesis file.\nStop Your Node\nThis will depend on your process manager. You should stop your Oasis Node process however this is done for your setup.\nWipe State\nWe do not suggest that you wipe all state. You might lose node identities and keys if you do it this way.\n\nBefore restarting your node you should wipe consensus state. The process for this is described in the Wiping Node State document.\nUpdate Configuration\nIf the Upgrade Log provides instructions for updating your node's configuration, update the /serverdir/etc/config.yml file accordingly.\nUpgrade Oasis Node\nBefore starting your node again, make sure you upgrade your Oasis Node binary to the current version specified in the Network Parameters.\nStart Your Node\nThis will depend on your process manager. If you don't have a process manager, you should use one. However, to start the node without a process manager you can start the Oasis Node like so:\noasis-node --config /serverdir/etc/config.yml\n\nClean Up\nAfter you're comfortable with your node deployment, you can clean up the genesis_dump.json file.\n"},"run-a-node/maintenance-guides/adding-or-removing-nodes.html":{"url":"run-a-node/maintenance-guides/adding-or-removing-nodes.html","title":"Adding or Removing Nodes","keywords":"","body":"Adding or Removing Nodes\nAt some point you may wish to add or remove nodes from your entity. In order to do so, you will need to have at least the following:\n\nAccess to a synced node\nAccess to your entity's private key\n\nOverview\nThe process for adding/removing nodes is similar and has the following steps:\n\nRetrieve your up to date entity descriptor (entity.json)\nUpdate your entity descriptor by adding/removing a node\nGenerate a register transaction to update your entity registration on the network.\n\nRetrieving Your Latest Entity Descriptor\nTo ensure that we do not update your entity descriptor (entity.json) incorrectly we should get the latest entity descriptor state. For this operation, you will need to know your the base64 encoding of your entity's public key.\nOn your server run this command:\nENTITY_PUBLIC_KEY=\"some-base64-public-key\"\noasis-node registry entity list \\\n    -a unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock -v | grep $ENTITY_PUBLIC_KEY\n\nUpdating Your Entity Descriptor\nTo Add a Node\nDue to how the node election process works, only a single node from your entity can be selected as a validator for any given epoch. Additional nodes will not give you more voting power nor will it, inherently, provide high availability to have multiple nodes.\n\nAdding a node is a simple operation that is directly supported by the oasis-node binary. For this operation you'll need to have initialized a new node, and you'll need to have the node_genesis.json file in order to add it to the entity descriptor.\nAssuming that the node_genesis.json is at /localhostdir/new_node/node_genesis.json the command is the following:\nNEW_NODE_GENESIS_PATH=/localhostdir/new_node/node_genesis.json\noasis-node registry entity update \\\n  --signer.dir /localhostdir/entity \\\n  --entity.node.descriptor /localhostdir/new_node/node_genesis.json\n\nTo Remove a Node\nRemoving a node requires updating the entity descriptor manually. The entity descriptor file is a simple JSON document that looks something like:\n{\n  \"id\": \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=\",\n  \"nodes\": [\n    \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=\"\n    \"BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB=\"\n  ],\n  \"allow_entity_signed_nodes\": false\n}\n\nIn the above entity descriptor 2 nodes are attached to the entity:\n\nA node with an identity AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=\nA node with an identity BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB=\n\nTo remove the the Node BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB= you would remove it from the array in the nodes field, like so:\n{\n  \"id\": \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=\",\n  \"nodes\": [\n    \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=\"\n  ],\n  \"allow_entity_signed_nodes\": false\n}\n\nUpdating Your Entity Registration on the Network\nFinally, to commit the changes on the network you'll need to generate a register transaction and submit that transaction to the network.\nGenerating a register Transaction\nRun this command on your localhost (as you need your entity's private key):\nGENESIS_FILE_PATH=\"path/to/the/current/genesis\"\nOUTPUT_REGISTER_TX_FILE_PATH=\"/localhostdir/update_entity_registration.tx\"\noasis-node registry entity gen_register \\\n  --genesis.file $GENESIS_FILE_PATH \\\n  --signer file \\\n  --signer.dir $ENTITY_DIR_PATH \\\n  --transaction.file $OUTPUT_REGISTER_TX_FILE_PATH \\\n  --transaction.fee.gas 1000 \\\n  --transaction.fee.amount 1 \\\n  --transaction.nonce 1\n\nOnce this has exited with a 0 status, you should have a file at $OUTPUT_REGISTER_TX_FILE_PATH. Upload that file to your server.\nSubmitting the Transaction\nRun this command on your server:\noasis-node consensus submit_tx \\\n  --transaction.file /serverdir/update_entity_registration.tx \\\n  -a unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock\n\nIf there are no errors, your entity registration should be updated. You can run this command to see the changes reflected:\nENTITY_PUBLIC_KEY=\"some-base64-public-key\"\noasis-node registry entity list \\\n    -a unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock -v | grep $ENTITY_PUBLIC_KEY\n\n"},"run-a-node/troubleshooting.html":{"url":"run-a-node/troubleshooting.html","title":"Node Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"Node Troubleshooting\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN TROUBLESHOOTING\nBefore you begin troubleshooting we suggest you check all of the following:\n\nCheck that your current binary version is the latest listed on the Current Network Parameters\nCheck the version on your localhost using oasis-node --version\nCheck the version on your server using oasis-node --version\n\n\nIf upgrading, make sure that you've wiped state (unless that is explicitly not\nrequired)\n\nIf you're doing anything with the entity:\n\nDo you have the latest genesis?\nDo you have the correct private key (or Ledger device).\nIf you're signing a transaction:\nDo you sufficient account balance to make the transaction?\nRun oasis-node stake account info\n\n\nAre you using the correct nonce?\nRun oasis-node stake account info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're generating a transaction:\nDo you have the latest genesis?\n\n\nIf you're submitting a transaction:\nDo you have the latest genesis?\nIs your node synced?

Reclaiming escrow does not complete immediately, but may be subject to a debonding period during which the tokens still remain escrowed.\nAddress\nA staking account address is represented by a truncated hash of a corresponding entity's public key, prefixed by a 1 byte address version.\nIt uses Bech32 encoding for text serialization with oasis as its human readable part (HRP) prefix.\nDelegation\nYou can delegate your tokens by submitting an escrow transaction that deposits a specific number of tokens into someone else’s escrow account (as opposed to staking tokens, which usually refers to depositing tokens into your own escrow account).\nIn other words, delegating your tokens is equivalent to staking your tokens in someone else's validator node. Delegating your tokens can give you the opportunity to participate in the Oasis Network's proof-of-stake consensus system and earn rewards via someone else's validator node.\nStaking\nYou can stake your tokens by submitting an escrow transaction that deposits a specific number of tokens into your escrow account.\nRewards\nBy delegating your tokens to someone else's node, you can earn a portion of the rewards earned by that node through its participation in the Oasis Network.\nCommission\nNode operators collect commissions when their node earns a staking reward for delegators. A validator node earns a staking reward for participating in the consensus protocol each epoch. The commission rate is a fraction of the staking reward.\nFor example, if our validator node earns a reward of 0.007 tokens, 0.0035 tokens are added to the escrow pool (increasing the value of our escrow pool shares uniformly), and 0.0035 tokens are given to us (issuing us new shares as if we manually deposited them).\nSlashing\nYour delegated tokens can be slashed if the node that you delegated your tokens to gets slashed for double signing.\n"},"manage-tokens/staking-and-delegating.html":{"url":"manage-tokens/staking-and-delegating.html","title":"Staking and Delegating","keywords":"","body":"Staking and Delegating\nStaking and Delegation on the Oasis Network is a wonderful way to hold your ROSE tokens.

If you are not in the \"ROSE System\" interface, you need to click on the button on the top left corner of the screen and scroll through the list of supported cryptocurrency assets to select \"ROSE\".\n\nOn the \"ROSE System\" interface, click on the \"Transfer\" button. This takes you to the \"ROSE Transfer\" screen. You need to enter a valid Oasis wallet address, which you can do manually, or by scanning a QR code with your device's camera. You can set the transfer amount in ROSE, as well as add an off-chain memo message for your own reference. After you have added all of the necessary information for your transfer, click on the \"OK\" button to proceed.\n\nFor additional troubleshooting and to provide any feedback on your Bitpie Wallet experience, please reach out to the Bitpie team directly at support@bitpie.com or via their website.\n\n"},"manage-tokens/mobile-wallets/bitpie-wallet-guide/testing-bitpie.html":{"url":"manage-tokens/mobile-wallets/bitpie-wallet-guide/testing-bitpie.html","title":"Testing Bitpie Wallet","summary":"The following documentation was provided by Bitpie for token holders who want to first test their wallet address on the Oasis Testnet.

Gaining access to your entity's/staking account's private key can compromise your tokens.\n\nThere are no additional things needed since the file-based signer is a part of Oasis Node CLI.\n"},"manage-tokens/oasis-cli-tools/setup.html":{"url":"manage-tokens/oasis-cli-tools/setup.html","title":"Setup","keywords":"","body":"Setup\nMake sure you have installed everything described in the Prerequisites section.\nServer commands\nTo run a command that requires a connection to an online Oasis node (i.e. the server), you need to either:\n\nchange the working directory to where the internal Oasis node UNIX socket is located (e.g. /serverdir/node/) before executing the command, or\npass the -a $ADDR flag where ADDR represents the path to the internal Oasis node UNIX socket prefixed with unix: (e.g.unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock).\n\nHere are some examples of Oasis Node CLI commands that need a connection to an online Oasis node:\n\noasis-node stake info: Shows general staking information.\noasis-node stake list: Lists all accounts with positive balance.\noasis-node stake account info: Shows detailed information for an account.\noasis-node consensus submit_tx: Submits a pre-generated transaction to the network.\n\nLocal commands\nThe following commands are intended to be run on your local machine and only need access to the network's current Genesis File and your signer's private key:\n\noasis-node stake account gen_transfer\noasis-node stake account gen_escrow\noasis-node stake account gen_reclaim_escrow\noasis-node stake account gen_amend_commission_schedule\n\nWe strongly suggest that you do not use any entity/staking account that is generated with the file-based signer on the Mainnet.\nIn case you need to use the file-based signer, make sure you only use it on an offline/air-gapped machine. Gaining access to your entity's/staking account's private key can compromise your tokens.\n\nJSON pretty-printing\nWe will pipe the output of commands that return JSON through Python's json.tool module to pretty-print it.\nBe aware that jq, the popular JSON CLI tool, converts all numbers to IEEE 754 64-bit values which can result in silent loss of precision and/or other changes.\nHence, we recommend avoiding its usage until this issue is resolved.\n\nCommon CLI Flags\nBase Flags\nAll commands for generating and signing transactions need the following base flags set:\n\n--genesis.file: Path to the genesis file, e.g. /localhostdir/genesis.json. \n\n  For convenience, set the GENESIS_FILE environment value to its value, e.g.:\n  GENESIS_FILE=/localhostdir/genesis.json\n\n\n--signer.dir: Path to entity's artifacts directory, e.g.  entity-$LEDGER_INDEX\nor /localhostdir/entity/\n\n\nSigner Flags\nCurrently, we provide two options for signing transactions:\n\nLedger-based signer.\nYou will need to set it up as described in our Oasis Core Ledger docs.\n\nFile-based signer.\nYou will need to create your Entity as described in Running a Node on the Network docs and set the following flags:\n\n--signer.backend file: Specifies use of the file signer.\n\n\n\nStoring Base and Signer flags in an Environment Variable\nTo make the transaction commands shorter and avoid typing errors, one can create an environment variable, e.g. TX_FLAGS, with all the Base Flags and Signer Flags configured for his particular set up.\nFor example, one could set TX_FLAGS for a Ledger device like below (make sure all LEDGER_* environment variables are set appropriately):\nTX_FLAGS=(--genesis.file \"$GENESIS_FILE\"\n  --signer.dir /localhostdir/entity\n  --signer.backend plugin\n  --signer.plugin.name ledger\n  --signer.plugin.path \"$LEDGER_SIGNER_PATH\"\n)\n\nOr, one could set TX_FLAGS like below to use a file signer:\nTX_FLAGS=(--genesis.file \"$GENESIS_FILE\"\n  --signer.backend file\n  --signer.dir /localhostdir/entity/\n)\n\nCommon Transaction Flags\nWhen generating a transaction, one needs to set the following transaction flags as appropriate for a given transaction:\n\n--stake.amount: Amount of base units to transfer, escrow, burn, etc.\n--transaction.file: Path to the file where to store the generated\ntransaction.\n\n--transaction.nonce: Incremental number that must be unique for each account's transaction.\nTo get your current account's nonce, see Checking Your Account nonce doc.\n\n--transaction.fee.gas: Maximum amount of gas (in gas units) a transaction can spend.  \n\n\n  Gas costs for different staking transactions are specified by the staking.params.gas_costs consensus parameter.  \n  To obtain its value from the genesis file, run:\n  cat $GENESIS_FILE | \\\n    python3 -c 'import sys, json; \\\n    print(json.dumps(json.load(sys.stdin)[\"staking\"][\"params\"][\"gas_costs\"], indent=4))'\n\n\n--transaction.fee.amount: Amount of base units we will pay as a fee for a transaction.\n\nNote that specifying a transaction's fee amount (via --transaction.fee.amount) and maximum gas amount (via --transaction.fee.gas) implicitly defines the gas price (in base units):\ngas_price = fee_amount / gas_amount\n\nGas price tells how much base units we are willing to pay for one gas unit.\nConsensus validators can configure their own minimum gas price (via consensus.tendermint.min_gas_price configuration flag) and will refuse to process transactions that have their gas price set below their minimum gas price.\nCurrently, there is no mechanism to discover what minimum gas prices are used by validators.\nFor more details, see Oasis Core #2526.\n\n

nonce, the incremental number that must be unique for each account's transaction, is 0. That means there haven't been any transactions made with this account as the source. Therefore, the next transaction should have nonce equal to 0.\n\nEscrow Account\nWe can observe that:\n\nThe amount of tokens that are actively bounded to the escrow account is ~10529 tokens.\nThe total number of shares for the tokens actively bounded to the escrow account is 10 trillion.\nThe amount of tokens that are currently debonding is 0.\nThe total number of shares for the tokens that are currently debonding is 0.\n\nCommission Schedule\nAn entity can also charge commission for tokens that are delegated to it. It would defined the commission schedule rate steps and the commission schedule rate bound steps. For more details, see the Amend Commission Schedule documentation.\nStake Accumulator\nEach escrow account also has a corresponding stake accumulator. It stores stake claims for an escrow account and ensures all claims are satisfied at any given point. Adding a new claim is only possible if all of the existing claims plus the new claim can be satisfied.\nWe can observe that the stake accumulator currently has two claims:\n\nThe registry.RegisterEntity claim is for registering an entity.\n\n  It needs to satisfy the global threshold for registering an entity (entity) which is defined by the staking consensus parameters.\n  To see the value of the entity global staking threshold, run the oasis-node stake info command as described in Common Staking Info doc.\n\nThe registry.RegisterNode.9Epy5pYPGa91IJlJ8Ivb5iby+2ii8APXdfQoMZDEIDc= claim is for registering the node with ID 9Epy5pYPGa91IJlJ8Ivb5iby+2ii8APXdfQoMZDEIDc=.  \n\n  It needs to satisfy the global staking threshold for registering a validator node (node-validator) which is defined by the staking consensus parameters.  \n  To see the value of the node-validator global staking threshold, run the oasis-node stake info command as described in Common Staking Info doc.  \n  In addition to the global thresholds, each runtime the node is registering for may define their own thresholds.

Please check back for updates.\nIf you have a general question on how to use and deploy our software, please read our Run a Node section or join our community Slack.\nAll community members are welcome and encouraged to commit code, documentation and enhancement proposals to the platform. Contribution guidelines can be found here.\n\nProposed Governance Model Overview\nThe Oasis Protocol Foundation proposes a representative democracy governance model based on a combination of off-chain and on-chain processes for the continued development of the Oasis Network. The Oasis Protocol Foundation will be tasked with guiding the long-term development of the platform and coordinating the community of development and network operations, with input collected from community members and changes to the network being voted on by node operators, with voting power based proportionally on staked and delegated tokens. We propose this model because we think it will provide a balanced voice to all engaged community members -- from developers of all sizes, to node owners, to token holders -- while at the same time still facilitating the swift deployment of network updates, new features, critical bug fixes.\nIn order for the community to balance distributed ownership and participation with speed and quality of platform development, we propose a hybrid model of off- and on-chain mechanisms, organized around the following key components:\n\nMinor Feature Requests\nMajor Feature Requests\nBug Fixes\n\nDecision Making Process\nMoving forward, our proposed process for reviewing and approving major protocol updates is:\n\nProposals for features and roadmap updates can come from anyone in the community in the form of issues (for minor features) or Architectural Decision Records (ADRs, for major features).\nReview and discussion of the proposals. Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all members of the community, from the newest user to the most experienced. All non-sensitive project management discussion takes place in the Oasis Protocol GitHub via issues (for minor features) and ADRs (for major features).\nDecision making process. In order to ensure that the project is not bogged down by endless discussion and continual voting, the project operates a policy of lazy consensus. This allows the majority of decisions to be made without resorting to a formal vote.\n\n  In general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or patch, it is recognised as having the support of the community. For lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least 72 hours before assuming that there are no objections to the proposal. This requirement ensures that everyone is given enough time to read, digest and respond to the proposal.\n  In case consensus is not reached through discussion, the project committers may vote to either accept the proposal or reject it. Votes are cast using comments in the proposal pull request. The proposal is accepted by a simple majority vote.\n\nFinal vote for approval. Once built, the community votes to approve each upgrade and the corresponding features that are included in the proposal. This voting process may initially be done off-chain but will eventually become an on-chain process. Entities holding stake will vote to approve changes, with each entity's voting power being proportional to their share of tokens staked relative to the total tokens staked.\nUpgrade. Node operators autonomously upgrade their system to run the new version of the software.\n\nMinor Feature Requests\nTo request new functionality, there are two primary approaches that will be most effective at receiving input and making progress.\nIf the feature is small - a change to a single piece of functionality, or an addition that can be expressed clearly and succinctly in a few sentences, then the most appropriate place to propose it is as a new feature request in the Oasis Core repository.\nMajor Feature Requests\nIf the feature is more complicated, involves protocol changes, or has potential safety or performance implications, then consider proposing an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) and submit it as a pull request to the Oasis Core repository. This will allow a structured review and commenting of the proposed changes. You should aim to get the ADR accepted and merged before starting on implementation. Please keep in mind that the project's committers still have the final word on what is accepted into the project.\nWe recommend that major protocol updates including a need to hard fork, roadmap and feature planning be conducted with recommendations from the Oasis Protocol Foundation and its technical advisory committee.\n\nUrgent Bug Fixes\nUrgent bug fixes will primarily be coordinated off-chain to optimize for speed in addressing any issues that are critical to the immediate health of the network. The Oasis Network community as a whole is collectively responsible for identifying and addressing bugs. As bugs are identified, the Oasis Protocol Foundation can serve as a line of first defense to triage these bugs and coordinate security patches for quick release.\nBugs are a reality for any software project. We can't fix what we don't know about!\nIf you believe a bug report presents a security risk, please follow responsible disclosure and report it by following the security disclosure information instead of filing a public issue or posting it to a public forum.\nWe will get back to you promptly.\nOtherwise, please, first search between existing issues in our repository and if the issue is not reported yet, file a new one.\nContributing to the Network\nIf you are interested in contributing to the Oasis Network's codebase or documentation, please review our contribution guidelines here.\n"},"contribute-to-the-network/contribution-guidelines.html":{"url":"contribute-to-the-network/contribution-guidelines.html","title":"Contribution Guidelines","keywords":"","body":"Contribution Guidelines\nThis document outlines our guidelines for contributing to the Oasis Network's codebase and documentation.

This has been reviewed and approved by community members and validators of the Oasis Network and is being reproduced and summarized here for easy access.\nAs proposed by the community, the upgrade from Mainnet Beta to Mainnet will kick off on November 18, 2020 at 16:00 UTC.\n\nCriteria for Mainnet\nIn order to transition from Mainnet Beta to Mainnet, community members have collectively suggested the following criteria be met. This is a collection of community feedback.\n\n[x]  Validators representing more than 2/3 of stake in the initial consensus committee successfully get online to launch Mainnet Beta.\n[x]  Beta network runs successfully for at least 10 days.\n[x]  No major security risks on the Beta Network have been discovered or otherwise unremediated and untested in the past 10 days.\n[x]  At least 50 validators run on the Network.\nThroughout Mainnet Beta there have been between 75 and 77 active validators on the network.\n\n\n[x]  There are NO Oasis Protocol Foundation or Oasis Labs nodes serving as validators.\n[x]  At least one block explorer exists to track network stability, transactions, and validator activity.\nThere is much more. See Block Explorers & Validator Leaderboards part of our docs.\n\n\n[x]  At least one qualified custodian supports the native ROSE token.\nCurrently, Anchorage and Finoa support the ROSE token. See Custody Providers part of our docs.\n\n\n[x]  At least one web wallet or hardware wallet supports native ROSE token.\nCurrently, Bitpie mobile wallet and RockX Ledger-backed web wallet are available and support ROSE token transfers. Support for staking and delegation is in development. See Mobile Wallets and Web Wallets parts of our docs.\n\n\n\nMechanics of Upgrading to Mainnet\nUpgrading from Mainnet Beta to Mainnet will require a coordinated upgrade of the Network. All nodes will need to configure a new genesis file that they can generate or verify independently and reset/archive any state from Mainnet Beta. Once enough (representing 2/3+ of stake) nodes have taken this step, the network will start.\nProposed Changes From Mainnet Beta to Mainnet\nThe Mainnet genesis file is intended to be as close as possible to the state of the Mainnet Beta network at the time of upgrade. That includes retaining validator token balances, retaining genesis file wallet allocations, and block height at time of the snapshot.\nIn addition, after receiving additional feedback from the community, the Oasis Protocol Foundation has proposed to increase the staking rewards model. In the new proposed model staking rewards will start at 20% (annualized) and range from 20% to 2% over the first 4 years of the network (see more in updated Token Metrics and Distribution doc).\nThe following parts of the genesis file will be updated:\n\nheight will remain the same as at the time of the snapshot of Mainnet Beta, i.e. 702000.\ngenesis_time will be set to 2020-11-18T16:00:00Z.\nchain_id will be set to oasis-1.\nhalt_epoch will be set to 9940 (approximately 1 year from Mainnet launch).\nstaking.params.disable_transfers will be omitted (or set tofalse)to enable transfers.\nstaking.params.reward_schedule will be updated to reflect the updated reward schedule as mentioned above.\nstaking.common_pool will be increased by 450M ROSE to fund increased staking rewards.\nstaking.ledger.oasis1qrad7s7nqm4gvyzr8yt2rdk0ref489rn3vn400d6, which corresponds to the Community and Ecosystem Wallet, will have its general.balance reduced by 450M ROSE to 1183038701000000000 and transferred to the Common Pool to fund increased staking rewards.\nextra_data will be set back to the value in the Mainnet Beta genesis file \nto include the Oasis network's genesis quote: ”Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” [submitted by Oasis Community Member Daniyar Borangaziyev]:\n  \"extra_data\": {\n    \"quote\": \"UXVpcyBjdXN0b2RpZXQgaXBzb3MgY3VzdG9kZXM/IFtzdWJtaXR0ZWQgYnkgT2FzaXMgQ29tbXVuaXR5IE1lbWJlciBEYW5peWFyIEJvcmFuZ2F6aXlldl0=\"\n  }\n\n\n\n\nSee the updated Network Parameters for the published Mainnet genesis file.\nFor more detailed instructions how to verify the provided Mainnet genesis file by comparing it to network state dump, see the Handling Network Upgrades guide.\n\nMainnet will use Oasis Core 20.12.2.\nMainnet Launch Support\nThe Oasis team will be offering live video support during the launch of Mainnet.

It includes the finalized Mainnet genesis file and initial token allocations. A few key highlights:\n\nTransfers are disabled during Mainnet Beta.  \nValidators participating in Mainnet Beta will be able to start earning staking rewards. \nAll account balances from Mainnet Beta will carry over to Mainnet when the network is upgraded and token transfers are enabled.\nThe reward schedule will be reset for Mainnet, but the rewards earned during Mainnet Beta will persist on Mainnet with the generation of the ROSE token.\n\nWhy launch a Mainnet Beta?\nThe primary goal of Mainnet Beta is to launch the Oasis Network in the most secure way possible.\nWe want to make sure we conduct extensive testing and vetting of our design prior to the network going live. Mainnet Beta enables the community to do a final check of the network in a focused and intentional manner, and allow the community to propose and decide when to turn on additional features on the network. This incremental process will help to set a strong foundation for the Oasis Network.\nMainnet Beta Timeline\nWe expect that the community of validators will launch Mainnet soon after Mainnet Beta.\nSuccess Criteria\nWhen the community of validators deems Mainnet Beta as a success, the foundation will propose an upgrade of the network to Oasis Mainnet.

This hash is used to verify for which network a given transaction is intended for.\nFor a more in-depth explanation of the genesis document, see the Genesis Document part of Oasis Core's developer documentation.\n\nGenesis Time and Chain ID\nThe genesis_time parameter is an ISO8601 UTC timestamp that specifies when the blockchain is officially going to launch. At the time of genesis, validators are expected to come online and start participating in the consensus process for operating the network. The network will start once validators representing more than 2/3 of stake in the initial consensus committee are online.\nThe chain_id is a human-readable version identifier for a blockchain. It is important to note, that this value alone doesn't dictate the version of the genesis file. To determine the correct version of a genesis file, the shasum of that genesis file will need to be generated. This can be done on Linux/macOS like so:\nshasum -a 256 genesis.json\n\nEpoch Time\nThe interval parameter specifies the number of blocks in an epoch. Epochs are used as a measure of time for staking reward schedules, debonding intervals, non-Mainnet test network expiration periods, and more. This value is set to 600, indicating that a new epoch on the Oasis Network transpires each time 600 new blocks are generated.\nNode Operator Registry\nWithin the registry object, there are a broad range of parameters that specify the initial set of node operators and their corresponding initial node statuses.\n\nmax_node_expiration - The maximum duration (in epochs) that node registrations last. The starting value is set to 2 in order to ensure that a node is continuously online, since the node’s registration would expire each time 2 epochs pass, requiring the node to re-register.\nentities - The entity registrations for initial node operators, including public key and signature information. The values here were obtained during the entity package collection process that took place during early September.\n\nIf you are an operator who successfully completed the KYC process and submitted your entity package by the deadline in early September, your entity should be included in the genesis file. Please review the entities section of the genesis file here to make sure that your entity is included in the genesis file if you were expecting it to be included. You can search for your entity in the genesis file using the entity public key from the entity package you submitted. If you encounter any issues with finding your entity, please let us know via the genesis file feedback form.\n\n\nnodes - The node registrations for initial node operators, including public key and signature information.\n\nGas Costs\nThe following parameters define the gas costs for various types of transactions on the network:\n\ncompute_commit - The cost for a compute commit for a ParaTime node. The value is set to 10000 gas.\nmerge_commit - The cost for a ParaTime merge commit. The value is set to 10000 gas.\nadd_escrow - The cost for an add_escrow (staking) transaction. The value is set to 1000 gas.\nburn - The cost for a burn transaction. The value is set to 1000 gas.\nreclaim_escrow - The cost for a reclaim_escrow transaction (for withdrawing staked tokens). The value is set to 1000 gas.\ntransfer - The cost for a transfer transaction (for sending tokens). The value is set to 1000 gas.\namend_commission_schedule - The cost for amending, or changing, a commission schedule. The value is set to 1000 gas.\n\nNode & Runtime Token Thresholds\nThere are several threshold parameters that specify the minimum number of tokens that need to be staked in order for a particular entity or a particular type of node to participate in the network. The minimum threshold specified for the entity, node-compute, node-keymanager, node-storage, and node-validator parameters is set to 100000000000 nROSE for each, indicating that you need to stake at least 100 ROSE tokens in order to have your entity or any of the specified nodes go live on the network.\nThere are also minimum thresholds for registering new runtimes. The minimum thresholds for registering runtime-compute and runtime-keymanager are set to 50000000000000 nROSE, indicating that you need to stake at least 50000 ROSE tokens in order to register a runtime.\nStaking & Rewards\nThese key parameters are related to staking and rewards on the network:\n\ndebonding_interval - The period of time (in epochs) that must pass before staked or delegated tokens that are requested to be withdrawn are returned to the account's general balance. The value is set to 336 epochs, which is expected to be approximately 14 days.\nreward_schedule - The staking reward schedule, indicating how the staking reward rate changes over time, defined at an epoch-by-epoch granular basis. The reward schedule uses a tapering formula with higher rewards being paid out at earlier epochs and then gradually decreasing over time.\nsigning_reward_threshold_numerator and signing_reward_threshold_denominator - These parameters define the proportion of blocks that a validator must sign during each epoch to receive staking rewards. A proportion of 3/4 means that a validator must maintain an uptime of at least 75% during an epoch in order to receive staking rewards for that period.\nrate_change_interval - The granularity at which at rate changes can be specified in a commission schedule. This limits the complexity of the commission schedule; the value is set to 1, indicating that the commission rate can change once per epoch.\nrate_bound_lead - The minimum lead time (in epochs) needed for changes to commission rate bounds. Operators need to wait before any rate bound changes go into effect. The value is set to 336, which is expected to be approximately 14 days.\nmax_rate_steps - The maximum allowed number of rate step changes in a commission schedule.The value is set to 10, indicating that the commission schedule can have a maximum of 10 rate steps.\nmax_bound_steps - The maximum allowed number of commission rate bound step changes in the commission schedule. The value is set to 10, indicating that the commission schedule can have a maximum of 10 bound steps.\nmin_delegation - The minimum amount of tokens required in a delegation. The value is set to 100000000000 nROSE, or 100 ROSE tokens.\nfee_split_weight_propose - The block proposer's share of transaction fees, set to a value of 2.\nfee_split_weight_next_propose - The next proposer's share of transaction fees, set to a value of 1.\nfee_split_weight_vote - A signer’s/voter’s share of transaction fees, set to a value of 1.\nreward_factor_epoch_signed - The factor for rewards distributed to validators who signed at least threshold blocks in a given epoch, set to a value of 1.\nreward_factor_block_proposed - The factor for rewards earned for block proposal. Set to 0, indicating validators get no extra staking rewards for proposing block.\n\nToken Supply & Ledger\nThe following parameters specify the total token supply, total token pool reserved for staking rewards, and account balances across the network at the time of genesis:\n\ntotal_supply - Specifies the total token supply for the network, which is fixed at 10 billion ROSE tokens.\ncommon_pool - The tokens reserved for staking rewards to be paid out over time.\nledger - The staking ledger, encoding all accounts and corresponding account balances on the network at the time of genesis, including accounts for initial operators, backers, custodial wallets, etc.\ndelegations - The encoding of the initial delegations at the time of genesis.\n\nIf you are an operator who successfully completed the KYC process and submitted your entity package by the deadline in early September, your account should be included in the genesis file, with an account general balance and escrow amount reflecting any grants, rewards, and Amber Network delegations you have received leading up to Mainnet. Please review the ledger section of the genesis file here to make sure that your account is included in the genesis file if you were expecting it to be included. Keep in mind that token balances are enumerated in nROSE, with 1 billion nROSE being equivalent to 1 ROSE token. You can search for account node in the ledger section of the genesis file by searching for your staking address, which is a Bech32-encoded address with the prefix \"oasis\". If you encounter any issues with finding your account in the ledger, please let us know via the genesis file feedback form.\n\nInterpreting your account balance in the ledger: Your general balance includes all of your tokens that have not been staked or delegated. This will be set to 100 tokens at genesis to cover gas, as most of your tokens (except that general balance of 100 tokens) will initially be staked (i.e. self-delegated) on your behalf. Within the escrow field, your active parameter shows the total tokens that have been allocated or delegated to you.\n\nSlashing\nThese parameters specify key values for the network's slashing mechanism:\n\namount - The amount of tokens to slash for double signing. The value is set to 100000000000 nROSE, or 100 ROSE tokens.\nfreeze_interval - The duration, in epochs, for which a node that has been slashed for double signing is “frozen,” or barred from participating in the network's consensus committee. A value of 18446744073709551615 (the maximum value for a 64-bit unsigned integer) means that any node slashed for double signing is, in effect, permanently banned from the network.\n\nConsensus\nThe following parameters are used to define key values for the network's consensus protocol:\n\nmin_validators - The minimum size for the consensus committee, set to 15 validators.\nmax_validators - The maximum size for consensus committee, set to 80 validators.\nmax_validators_per_entity - The maximum number of nodes from a given entity that can be in the consensus committee at any time. Set to a value of 1.\nbackend - Defines the backend consensus protocol. Specified as \"tendermint\".\ntimeout_commit - Specifies long to wait after committing a block before starting a new block height, in nanoseconds (this affects block interval). Set to 5000000000 nanoseconds, or 5 seconds.\nmax_tx_size - Maximum size for consensus-layer transactions, in bytes, set to 32768 bytes.\nmax_block_size - Maximum block size, in bytes, set to 22020096 bytes\nmax_block_gas - Maximum block gas, set to 0, which specifies an unlimited amount of gas.\npublic_key_blacklist - A list of the public keys that cannot be used on the network.\n\nTransfers\nPlease note that transfers will be disabled for Mainnet Beta and we expect once proposed by the community and adopted enabled to begin Mainnet. Transfers are enabled on Mainnet Dry Run to test this feature out completely.\nFeedback\nWe look forward to receiving the community’s feedback on the Oasis Network’s genesis file!

Combined with its high throughput and secure architecture, the Oasis Network is able to power private, scalable DeFi, revolutionizing Open Finance and expanding it beyond traders and early adopters to a mass market. Its unique privacy features can not only redefine DeFi, but also create a new type of digital asset called Tokenized Data that can enable users to take control of the data they generate and earn rewards for staking it with applications — creating the first ever responsible data economy.\nFirst Privacy-Enabled Blockchain: The Oasis Network is the world’s first scalable, privacy-enabled blockchain. ParaTimes on the Oasis Network can leverage confidential computing technology such as secure enclaves to keep data confidential — unlocking new use cases and applications for blockchain.\nScalable, Private DeFi: The Oasis Network’s privacy-first design can expand DeFi beyond traders and early adopters — unlocking a new mainstream market. Plus its innovative scalability design brings fast speeds and high-throughput to DeFi transactions.\nFirst to Enable Data Tokenization: The Oasis Network can Tokenize Data, unlocking game changing use cases for blockchain, and an entirely new ecosystem of apps and projects on the network — powering the next generation of privacy-first applications.\nRapidly Growing Community: The Oasis Network has a thriving community of close to a thousand node operators, developers, enterprise partners, ambassadors, and nearly ten thousand community members engaged in global social channels.\nTop-Tier Team: The Oasis Team is made up of top talent from around the world with backgrounds from Apple, Google, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, Harvard and more — all committed to growing and expanding the impact of the Oasis Network. **\nIs the Oasis Protocol Foundation still taking grant applications for projects that are building new dApps?\nYes! We are still taking grant applications. You can apply any time here.\nWhen is Mainnet Launch?\nThe Oasis Network is currently running a release candidate for Mainnet -- the Amber Network. The next version of Mainnet is coming soon!\n\nArchitecture\nWhat kind of blockchain is the Oasis Network? Does it use sidechains?\nThe Oasis Network is a Layer 1 blockchain protocol using a BFT, proof-of-stake consensus system. The network’s innovative ParaTime architecture enables us to scale without using sidechains. For more information please refer to our platform whitepaper.\nWhat does the Oasis Network’s architecture look like?\nThe Oasis Network is a Layer 1, proof-of-stake, decentralized network. It has two main components, the Consensus Layer and the ParaTime Layer.\n\nThe Consensus Layer is a scalable, high-throughput, secure, proof-of-stake consensus run by a decentralized set of validator nodes.\nThe ParaTime Layer hosts many parallel runtimes (ParaTimes), each representing a replicated compute environment with shared state.\n\n\nHow is a ParaTime different from a Parachain?\nUnlike a Parachain, a ParaTime does not need to do consensus itself, making them simpler to develop and more integrated into the network as a whole. ParaTimes take care of compute and discrepancy detection is used to ensure correctness and integrity of execution, making ParaTimes more efficient than Parachains and other chain designs that rely on sharding.\nWho will be running all of these ParaTimes? Can anyone run a ParaTime?\nThe network is agnostic in this regard. Anyone can run a ParaTime. It is completely left up to the devs and users to see which ones provide the functionality that they need. Examples of ParaTimes in development include the Oasis Labs Data Sovereignty ParaTime and the Second State Virtual Machine, an EVM compatible Runtime.\nWhat consensus mechanism are you running? Is it BFT?\nThe Oasis Network uses Tendermint as its BFT consensus protocol. Given that the consensus layer uses a BFT protocol, the Oasis Network offers instant finality, meaning that once a block is finalized, it cannot be reverted (at least not for full nodes). A ParaTime commitment goes into a block and as such the ParaTime state is also finalized and cannot be reverted once a block is finalized.\nWhy doesn’t the Oasis Network do sharding? Does that mean it’s slow?\nThe Oasis Network does not use sharding. Instead, Oasis leverages a discrepancy detection model leading up to roothash updates, giving the network the same scalability benefits that sharding offers but with added benefits that come from a design that is much simpler to implement in practice. Sharding is a nice idea in theory but comes with a lot of complexity and costs that make it harder to implement in practice. From a security perspective, the complexity of sharding also makes it harder to audit and inherently more vulnerable to security breaches The Oasis Network’s discrepancy detection-based approach provides the same benefits as sharding through a cleaner, simpler, more efficient implementation. Ultimately, the Oasis Network’s unique scalability mechanism ensures that the network is not only fast (like sharding networks purport to be) but also versatile and secure enough to support a wide range of real-world workloads.\nHow does storage work on the Oasis Network? Do you use IPFS?\nStorage on the Oasis Network is determined by each ParaTime. There is a clear separation of concerns between the consensus layer and the runtime layer. The ParaTimes that make up the runtime layer have a lot of flexibility in how they choose to manage storage. For instance, the ParaTime being developed by Oasis Labs can support IPFS as its storage solution. Other ParaTime developers could opt to implement different storage mechanisms based on their own unique storage needs.\nOpen Finance & DeFi\nDoes the Oasis Network have a vision for DeFi? Is it different from the mainstream view of DeFi?\nThe first generation of DeFi dApps has provided the market with a huge number of protocols and primitives that are meant to serve as the foundation for the specific components of a new financial system. Despite the current focus on short-term returns, we at Oasis believe the goal of DeFi applications should be to give rise to a new financial system that removes subjectivity, bias, and inefficiencies by leveraging programmable parameters instead of status, wealth, and geography. Oasis aims to support the next wave of DeFi applications by offering better privacy and scalability features than other Layer 1 networks.\nI’ve seen Oasis use both the terms “Open Finance” and “DeFi”? What’s the difference?\nThe terms “Open Finance” and “DeFi” are interchangeable. However, we believe that “Open Finance” better represents the idea that the new financial system should be accessible to everyone who operates within the bounds of specific programmable parameters, regardless of their status, wealth, or geography.\nWill Oasis provide oracle solutions for use in DeFi applications?\nOasis recently announced a partnership with Chainlink as the preferred oracle provider of the Oasis Network. This integration is ongoing.\nWhat aspects of DeFi require privacy? How can the Oasis Network’s focus on privacy help with DeFi applications?\nIn the current generation of DeFi, some miners and traders are leveraging the inefficiencies of Ethereum to stack mining fees and interest rates, while preventing many more people from participating in the industry. Privacy can play a strong role in making the network function properly by reducing these inefficiencies. At the application level, privacy is an enabler. For instance, strong privacy guarantees can encourage established institutions to participate in the system because these institutions would be able to protect their interests and relationships. Additionally, privacy features can serve as the foundation for a reputation system, thereby unlocking the full potential of undercollateralized lending. We keep hearing that privacy is the next big thing in DeFi, and we look forward to empowering developers to build the next generation of DeFi applications.\nHow does privacy help create a new system of Open Finance?\nExisting financial systems and data systems are not open at all. They are only accessible to a select few. Privacy has a much broader meaning than just keeping something private. Thanks to privacy-preserving computation, users can retain ownership of their information and grant others access to compute on their data without actually revealing (or transferring) their data. This will enable users to accrue data yields by essentially staking their data on the blockchain, unlocking a wide range of new financial opportunities.\nOpen Finance refers to the idea that status, wealth, and geography won't block you from accessing a certain financial product. Adherence to a programmable set of parameters will determine whether someone can participate or not, making new financial opportunities open to more people around the world. For example, services such as lending protocols could offer different interest rates depending on the history of that user. What's game changing for the world of finance is that companies would not have to rely on a centralized score such as FICO - they would be able to build their own models.\nWhy would anyone choose to build a DeFi project on Oasis over Ethereum?\nThe network’s cutting-edge scalable features can help unblock DeFi as it works today, fixing the high-transaction fees and slow throughput currently plaguing other Layer 1 networks. Combined, Oasis’ unique ability to provide scalable, private DeFi is expected to make it the leading platform for unlocking the next generation of DeFi markets and use cases.\nToken\nHow will the Oasis Network’s token be used in the network when it launches?\nThe ROSE token will be used for transaction fees, staking, and delegation at the Consensus Layer.\nPrivacy\nHow does the Oasis Network achieve privacy and confidentiality? Is it through homomorphic encryption?\nThere are many ways to achieve confidentiality. Using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) is one way. This is what we do. In effect, we provide end-to-end confidentiality for transactions where state and payload are encrypted at rest, in motion, and, more importantly, in compute. homomorphic encryption is another technique for confidentiality. At this time, anyone can build a ParaTime on the Oasis Network that uses homomorphic encryption to provide confidentiality. We are not prescriptive about what approach developers should take.\nSomething worth noting is that privacy and confidentiality are not equivalent. Privacy implies confidentiality but not the other way around. For privacy, there are techniques such as differential privacy that can be implemented.\nInteroperability\nCan you run Ethereum smart contracts on the Oasis Network? Or if not directly run smart contracts, could you access a bridge between Ethereum ERC20 assets and Oasis?\nIn short, yes! The Oasis Network supports EVM-compatible ParaTimes which will support a wide range of applications.\n"}}}
